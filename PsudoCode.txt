Psudo code for DV protocol

wait ( sees a link cost change to neighbor V
		|| A receives update from neighbor V){

	if (c(A,V) changes by d){
		for (all destinations Y through V){
			D(A,Y, V) =  D(A,Y,V) + d 
		} 
	}
	else if(update D(V, Y) received from V){   /* shortest path from V to some Y has changed  */ 
		D(A,Y,V) = c(A,V) + D(V, Y);
	}
	if (there is a new minimum for destination Y){
		send new message containing D(A, Y) to all neighbors  /* D(A,Y) denotes the min D(A,Y,*) */
	}
}
